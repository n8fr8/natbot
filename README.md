# natbot
I am making a bot in my own image.... let's hope it doesn't go wrong.

# install

This project is built upon Chatterbot, which you can find here: https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/

You need to use Python 3.5+ for this to work.

Also install Chatterbot from source, like so:

> pip3 install git+git://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot.git@master
